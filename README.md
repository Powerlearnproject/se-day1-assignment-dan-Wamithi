Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the branch of computer science which involve designing, developing, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software.
Importance of software engineering in the technology industry include 
1. Ensures software perform its functionality without any bias.
2. Helps to develop software with good worklow and give high-standard software.
3. Ensure that software can handle increased load without affecting performance

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The three milestone in the evolution of software engineering include: mastering complexity, mastering process, mastering machine.
Mastering complexity- Mastering complexity refers to the development of structured methodologies, programming paradigms, and tools to manage the growing complexity of software systems.
Mastering process-  refers to the development of systematic approaches and methodologies to guide software development.
Mastering machine- refers to the advancements in hardware, programming languages, and software tools that have allowed software engineers to harness the full potential of computing machines efficiently

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of software development life cycle includes; planing, requirement gathering, designing, implementation(coding), testing and deployment.
1. Planing- This is where the software engineer plans what needs to develop in regard to the requirement of project or the end end user(client)
2. Requirement gathering- at this step softwvre engineer find and documents all the necessary requirements for the completion of given project.
3. Designing- involves crafting or building the framework.
4. Implementation- this is where the real coding is done. Turning design in to real thing through coding.
5. Deployment and maintenance- involves installing the software to the user.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is sequential, you cant move to the next stage without completing the previous step while Agile methodology is iterlative and sequential, has mmultiple cycles.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Roles and responsibilites of software developer include.
1. developing software or applicvtions using programming languages or coding.
2. Maintain and update software when needed to keep it functional.
3. collaborating with the teams to ensure they deliver accurate software within a given timeframe

   Role of Quality Assurance
   1. create standards and procedures for programmers to use.
   2. Review that software meets qualificactions before being deployed.
   3. They analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.

Role of Project Manager.
1. Leads software development team.
2. create roadmap of the project.
3. Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
4. Has the role to deliver complete working softwares to the client.
   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE is a software platform which gives programmers a place to write their code, compile and debug code examplr: Visual Studio code, android studio, Pycharm.
VCS- software tools which help programmers to track changes in their code. example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. challenge: Tight deadlines and unrealistic expectations can lead to stress and burnout.
   solution: Use Agile & Scrum Methodologies – Break work into smaller, manageable tasks using sprints and iterative development.
2. challenge: Identifying and fixing software bugs can be time-consuming and frustrating.
   solution: Use Debugging Tools – Utilize built-in debuggers in IDEs like Visual Studio Code
3. challenge: Software vulnerabilities can be exploited by hackers. Security issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS).
    solution: Conduct Regular Security Audits – Use tools like OWASP to find vulnerabilities


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: esure diving the application into modules and test each unit indepedently ensuring that all units are functioning properly.
Intergration Testing: verifies that all modules in the application are working properly as recomended.
System Testing: examines every component of an application to make sure that they work as a complete and unified whole.
Acceptace Testing: a quality assurance process that evaluates software to ensure it meets user needs and business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering: the process of designing inputs for AI models to produce desired outputs.

importance 
1. Makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
2. Create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
3. Gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Describe artificial intelligence."

Why is this vague?
Too broad – AI includes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, etc.
Lacks direction – Should it be an overview, a technical explanation, or a historical perspective?
No target audience – Is it for students, business owners, or developers?
Improved Prompt:
"Write a 500-word article for business executives explaining how artificial intelligence is transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and retail, with real-world examples."

Why is this improved?
1. Clear topic – Focuses on AI’s impact on industries rather than AI in general.
2. Specific details – Covers healthcare, finance, and retail, with real-world examples.
3. Defined format & length – Specifies a 500-word article, ensuring conciseness.
4. Target audience – Tailored for business executives, making it more practical and relevant.
